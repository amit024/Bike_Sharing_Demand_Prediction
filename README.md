# 🚴‍♀️ **Bike Rental Demand Prediction**  

### 📊 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to predict the **demand for bike rentals** using machine learning techniques, specifically **Linear Regression**. The dataset contains historical data on bike rentals, weather conditions, and time-based features. The goal is to build a predictive model to assist bike rental services in optimizing their fleet management and availability.
